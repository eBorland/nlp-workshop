When penguins are in danger of over heating

How do these typically chill characters stay cool over the long polar summer?

When you're used to sub-zero temperatures, 17C can feel downright balmy!
King penguins are active throughout the long summer days so they have to deal with a very uncharacteristic polar problem - sizzling heat!
Any effort can easily lead to overheating, so to combat the high temperatures, these heavily insulated birds stretch out on their stomachs so their feet can cool off in the breeze.
Chicks, in their downy winter coats, are at an even greater risk of overheating. Those too young to swim in open water find welcome relief with a quick splash around in a small river or with a trip to the penguin spa, complete with penguin 'mud packs'.
When it comes to the adult penguins, they enjoy nothing more than a bracing dip in the chilly Southern Ocean.
