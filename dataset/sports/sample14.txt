Former USC wide receiver Joseph Lewis sentenced to year in jail for felony domestic violence


Former USC wide receiver Joseph Lewis pleaded no contest to felony domestic violence on Monday, stemming from an arrest on July 18, according to the Los Angeles County district attorneyâ€™s office.
Lewis, 18, was sentenced to one year in Los Angeles County jail and five years probation. He was also ordered to take 52 domestic violence classes, and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mildred Escobedo issued a 10-year protective order against Lewis.
Prosecutors said Lewis punched, scratched and strangled his girlfriend during a dispute in July, prompting his second arrest for domestic violence this year.
His girlfriend is the mother of his infant child, City News Service reported.

Lewis was removed from the team shortly after his first arrest.
A former five-star recruit from Hawkins High in South Los Angeles, Lewis had little impact for the Trojans. He appeared in 11 games as a freshman in 2017 and caught only four for 39 years, appearing mostly on special teams.
